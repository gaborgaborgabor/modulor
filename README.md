Hardware samples 

Hello David, Hello Students, 
here are the hardware examples that you may need to stick it together. 

## Buttons and LEDs
in the button_led.py you find simple examples of how to control pins and buttons if needed. In this case we use GPIOZERO libary

## Relay Control
The usage of the relay are similar to the LEDs, the only thing we need to know is the initial setup for the pins. They have to be init as ground and down, because the relay reconnise only the negativ value via ground to swich from NC (normal close) to open. 

## The scale_sample
here you can find how to use the scale and get precise values out of it. See comments in the code.
